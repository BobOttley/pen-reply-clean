We\u2019re looking for a school that provides both strong academic challenge and a nurturing environment, as he's bright but quite sensitive.\n\nCould you tell us more about how you support children who need stretching academically, while also ensuring they feel emotionally secure? We're also curious about music opportunities \u2014 he plays the violin \u2014 and whether you offer any taster sessions or trial days before enrolling.\n\nThank you in advance.\nKind regards,  \nMrs Eliza Hartley",
    "reply": "Subject: Welcome to Bassett House School\n\nDear Mrs Hartley,\n\nThank you for reaching out and considering Bassett House School for your son. I understand your desire for a school that offers both strong academic challenge and a nurturing environment, especially for a bright but sensitive child. \n\nAt Bassett House, we pride ourselves on being a school with a big heart. Our teachers are dedicated to knowing each pupil well, recognising not only their strengths but also their quirks and potential. We believe that academic excellence and kindness can go hand in hand. Our curriculum is designed to be both challenging and engaging, ensuring that children are stretched academically while feeling emotionally secure.\n\nWe are particularly mindful of the needs of sensitive children and provide a supportive pastoral environment. Our smaller school setting allows us to foster genuine relationships, helping children feel at home and secure. We encourage all pupils to \u2018Be the best you can be\u2019, and this ethos permeates everything we do. \n\nRegarding music opportunities, we are delighted to offer a range of musical programmes, including violin lessons. We recognise the importance of nurturing artistic talents alongside academic pursuits, and our music department is vibrant and supportive.\n\nWe would love to invite you and your son to experience Bassett House firsthand. We offer taster sessions and trial days, which provide a wonderful opportunity for prospective pupils to engage with our school community. Additionally, I would be more than happy to arrange a tour of the school or a meeting to discuss your son\u2019s specific needs in greater detail.\n\nPlease feel free to reach out to me directly to arrange a visit or if you have any further questions. \n\nWarm regards,\n\nJess Ottley-Woodd  \nDirector of Admissions  \n<a href=\"https://www.bassetths.org.uk/about/\" target=\"_blank\">Bassett House School</a>"
