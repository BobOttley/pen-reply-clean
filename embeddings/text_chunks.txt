Inspiring a Love of Learning | Basset House School Inspiring a Love of Learning The key to successful learning in the Early Years is to teach children without them realising they are being taught. As a school-based Nursery, the children are part of the Bassett House School community, a 2 to 11 co-educational school. We pride ourselves that as a Nursery School, we provide an early childhood education, alongside childcare, sparking a true love of learning at an early age. Alongside the Montessori approach, we offer a more structured curriculum, preparing the children for the educational journey they are about to embark on! The curriculum is inspirational, well planned and taught with clearly articulated expectations for pupils.

------------------------------------------------------------

https://www.bassetths.org.uk/early-years/inspiring-a-love-of-learning/
Children in the early years enjoy a curriculum tailored to their needs and interests. Independent Schools Inspectorate, 2024 Children are given opportunities for indoor and outdoor activities every day and through play and structured learning, pupils develop a variety of skills and interests. Learning is seamlessly interwoven into the fabric of our pupils’ exciting day-to-day experiences. We want all children to develop a love for learning and to have fun and enjoy achievement and success in all aspects of their education. We strive to ensure that children feel happy in their environment and immediately feel part of our wider school community.

------------------------------------------------------------

https://www.bassetths.org.uk/early-years/inspiring-a-love-of-learning/
From the very beginning, it was clear that Bassett House is a place where children are truly cared for and nurtured in a calm and thoughtful environment. Our son has grown so much during his time here-both academically and personally. It’s been amazing to see how much he has learned, Parent, 2025 An Arts Rich Curriculum An arts-rich curriculum fosters creativity, helping children express themselves through various mediums like music, visual arts, and movement. It also enhances cognitive development by encouraging problem-solving, critical thinking, and fine motor skills. Personal, Social and Emotional Development We endorse a Growth Mindset approach where pupils are confident to make decisions and are willing to always ‘have a go’.

------------------------------------------------------------

https://www.bassetths.org.uk/early-years/inspiring-a-love-of-learning/
From birth, children are constantly growing, adapting and learning from their environment. At Bassett Bear House, we support the children’s personal, social and emotional development (PSED), encouraging them to build strong relationships with children and adults, develop self confidence, consider the needs of others and experience pride and success. We endorse a Growth Mindset approach where pupils are confident to make decisions and are willing to always ‘have a go’. We encourage our AmBassettors to learn about the beauty of making mistakes as a vehicle for learning and growing. Communication and Language Our teachers take every opportunity to foster dialogue and build vocabulary whilst establishing positive speaking and listening skills.

------------------------------------------------------------

https://www.bassetths.org.uk/early-years/inspiring-a-love-of-learning/
We create a language rich environment where children are encouraged to express themselves and share their thoughts, ideas and feelings, in a space where they understand that their contributions are always valued. Language development is supported by a number of activities such as storytelling and role play which stimulate communication skills and vocabulary development. We help Bassett pupils to internalise and innovate well-known stories through a story-making approach. Physical Development A wide range of activities and resources help to refine fine motor skills and physical development in our young learners. Children learn about the importance of keeping the body and mind active and healthy.

------------------------------------------------------------

https://www.bassetths.org.uk/early-years/inspiring-a-love-of-learning/
We enjoy lots of physical learning opportunities, including weekly PE lessons, Forest School style exploration in our urban garden and visits to Kensington Memorial Park. We ensure our pupils have opportunities to develop their physical dexterity in a fun way. Favourites include our ‘dough discos’ and shape and letter writing in everything from glitter to chocolate spread. Literacy A fundamental life skill, literacy is a key component of the teaching at Bassett Bear House. Reading and writing are one of the most essential milestones in the life of our young children. We develop young imaginations through active storytelling and role play, aiming to instil a love of reading in our children.

------------------------------------------------------------

https://www.bassetths.org.uk/early-years/inspiring-a-love-of-learning/
When each child is ready, they begin exploring sounds through a systematic phonics teaching approach, as well as their corresponding letters in the alphabet, linking sounds to letters. They enjoy looking for things in our stimulating EYFS environment that they can connect to a sound (animals, toys, foods, objects etc). Once a child understands that words have beginning, medial and end sounds, they are shown the importance of “sounding out” words (d-o-g), and intuitively (with a little bit of help), they begin to read and write. Maths Joining in with number songs and rhymes introduces our learners to mathematics in the Early Years.

------------------------------------------------------------

https://www.bassetths.org.uk/early-years/inspiring-a-love-of-learning/
Children use concrete resources: touching, feeling and manipulating materials to strengthen their understanding of different ways of working with and learning about numbers. A range of kinesthetic, practical and fun activities rooted in a Montessori approach help to ensure children are familiar with concepts such as: colour, shape, pattern, sorting, matching, sequencing and counting – building a strong foundation from which they can continue to build as they move through the school. Our pupils are taught to confidently count forwards and backwards to twenty with a solid understanding of what each number looks like so that they can understand terms like more than, less than and groups of. Our mastery approach ensures a strong mathematical foundation upon which to build.

------------------------------------------------------------

https://www.bassetths.org.uk/early-years/inspiring-a-love-of-learning/
Understanding the World Bassett pupils develop a keen interest and curiosity in the world around them. At Bassett, we nurture pupils in their play and exploration, challenging them to ask questions and find things out for themselves. Our urban garden and cross curricular topics lend themselves to this area of discovery. The children at Bassett House are competent users of technology and when appropriate, are introduced to laptops and iPads where they develop skills which they can use across all areas of learning. Pupils are also introduced to programming and algorithms, using tools such as Beebots for an early introduction to coding. Expressive Arts and Design At Bassett Bear House, all of our pupils are given opportunities to harness their creativity.

------------------------------------------------------------

https://www.bassetths.org.uk/early-years/inspiring-a-love-of-learning/
Through class assemblies and whole-school performances, children can show off their personalities and build confidence in speaking aloud and expressing themselves. In our interactive learning zone, children explore and create using crayons, chalks, paints and glue with a range of modelling items readily available to them, giving limitless possibilities for imagination. Specialist lessons in music and eurhythmics give the children the opportunity to express themselves through movement, dance and song. Eurythmics- a beautiful blend of music, movement, expression and rhythm is unique to Bassett Bear House and has been taught since the school opened its doors to just a handful of pupils in 1947.

https://www.bassetths.org.uk/early-years/montessori-approach/
Montessori Approach | Nursery London | Basset House School Montessori Approach When Bassett House was founded by Sylvia Rentoul in 1947, she developed her small school paying close attention to the Montessori method. Fast forward to the present day and Bassett House Nursery School still prides itself on incorporating many aspects of the Montessori philosophy in teaching methods for our youngest learners. Using this method we encourage our children to make their own choices, build confidence and self-esteem and foster their creativity and independence. Through this, we create a foundation for life-long learning. A Montessori Nursery School A Montessori Nursery is set up and run on the educational principles originally developed by Maria Montessori in the early 20th century.

------------------------------------------------------------

https://www.bassetths.org.uk/early-years/montessori-approach/
The Montessori approach is holistic, aiming to develop the whole child. Fundamental to the approach is the belief that a child’s early years from birth to six are the period when they have the greatest capacity to learn. We provide an environment in which children develop on an individual basis guided from within by their natural curiosity and with the careful guidance of our experienced Montessori teachers. We see the early years as a preparation for life and a foundation for everything which follows. Who was Maria Montessori? Born in 1870 in Italy, she was the first woman to graduate as a doctor of medicine from the University of Rome. This led her to focus on children with learning difficulties.

------------------------------------------------------------

https://www.bassetths.org.uk/early-years/montessori-approach/
Rather than seeing herself as a traditional educator, she approached education scientifically, using the classroom as a lab to observe children and test new ideas. Montessori believed that a warm, secure environment helps children absorb information best. She saw that children learn best through hands-on experiences and developed resources that encouraged independence and a love of learning. Her method proved highly effective, and she spent her life traveling the world, establishing schools, lecturing, and writing until her death in 1952. Montessori’s innovative practices have deeply influenced global early childhood education. Why do we use the Montessori Method? We use it because it is effective.

------------------------------------------------------------

https://www.bassetths.org.uk/early-years/montessori-approach/
Alongside other methods and techniques, it has a proven successful track record in the early years of child development in maximising each child’s own abilities. It provides a very solid foundation and academic base for children at the start of their school life. Many independent schools have successfully incorporated Montessori methods into their delivery of the Early Years Foundation Stage Curriculum. Our partners in Montessori Practice We are lucky enough to have Montessori experts within the Dukes Education family, from whom we draw inspiration and advice. Our Early Years department undergo a mock inspection every year by Aimee Kimbell, Montessori expert and Principal of Riverside Nursery Schools , a group of five beautiful Montessori nurseries in west London.

------------------------------------------------------------

Teaching Philosophy | Prep School London | Basset House School Teaching Philosophy Every child has their own unique way of learning. Since time immemorial, the best education has always had the same thing at its core — wonderful teachers spending quality time with students. So, at Bassett House School, we only recruit the very best teaching staff. With them, we create an environment to challenge, encourage and nourish the growing minds of our pupils. We embrace a variety of teaching methods including: Montessori (for younger children); visual, auditory and kinaesthetic methodology; the mastery approach to learning, particularly in mathematics; and visible learning strategies.

------------------------------------------------------------

https://www.bassetths.org.uk/prep-6-11-yrs/teaching-philosophy/
The advantage of being independent is that we are able to glean the best practices in terms of international standards of pedagogy, and cherry-pick from these various methods which, when combined with small class sizes, allows us to tailor our teaching approach to each individual child. As a member of the Dukes Education family, we also know there’s power in the collective. Our students benefit from the constant sharing of best practice among Dukes schools, and the stringent standards held to by a wide team of senior leaders who, combined, have an exceptional record of experience and expertise in education. Students develop culturally and socially, as well as academically, enjoying a well-rounded education full of fun and laughter.

------------------------------------------------------------

https://www.bassetths.org.uk/prep-6-11-yrs/teaching-philosophy/
We work hard to help every child find something that fulfills them – to find their extraordinary – the thing only they can contribute to the world. Assessing children in their primary school years can be inaccurate, therefore, we have a non-selective point of entry embracing a rich diversity of abilities. Bassett House School Our teachers are highly adept at varying resources and teaching styles ensuring all children feel included and make excellent progress in mixed ability groups. This dynamic is particularly beneficial when we set children challenging tasks, or encourage them to work, through guided play, in teams. Importantly, they are taught mistakes are not failures, but a positive sign they are trying. Their efforts will always be encouraged, regardless of the outcome.

------------------------------------------------------------

https://www.bassetths.org.uk/prep-6-11-yrs/teaching-philosophy/
Educational techniques such as Growth Mindset and Critical Thinking encourage the children to develop as individuals and be self-motivated. We use Bassett Bear to make the Mastery approach to learning fun and accessible, and children benefit from being in a co-educational environment where girls and boys learn from each other, both academically and socially. We also offer Continuous Provision to children when a learning difficulty is suspected or detected. Finally, we are proud of our diverse multicultural school community and there is a great deal of support for children whose first language is not English.

Prep Curriculum | Prep School London | Basset House School Prep Curriculum We boast a rich and bespoke curriculum across the school which is flexible to achieve the best outcomes for our pupils across a variety of subjects taught by specialist teachers. Gleaning the best practices from a host of international curricula, we are able to maintain a flexible approach, while achieving exceptional standards across the school. Co-educational environment Our children benefit from being in a co-educational environment where girls and boys learn from each other, both academically and socially. English A love for the English language is promoted in all classes.

------------------------------------------------------------

https://www.bassetths.org.uk/prep-6-11-yrs/curriculum/
Pupils, regardless of their ability, feel that their imagination and use of vocabulary are two very powerful tools that enable them to communicate and inspire others. Alongside encouraging reading, or being read to at home, we expose pupils to a wide variety of stories, genres and authors to foster a love of reading, enable the children to gain a deeper appreciation of different texts and to translate that into their own writing. Events that bring English literature to life punctuate the calendar: our inter-house poetry competition, book week, trips to see plays on the London stage, drama workshops and visits by published authors.

------------------------------------------------------------

https://www.bassetths.org.uk/prep-6-11-yrs/curriculum/
Bassett House School children leave us as confident and articulate communicators, well able to use the written word to persuade, entertain, amuse, educate or enlighten their readers. Phonics A love for the English language is promoted in all classes. Pupils, regardless of their ability, feel that their imagination and use of vocabulary are two very powerful tools that enable them to communicate and inspire others. We use a ‘teach, practise, apply’ lesson approach aimed to cater for all learning styles. We ensure children gain a secure understanding of phonics right from age 3 by reading with each child every day through to the end of Form 2 and allowing them to progress at their own pace.

------------------------------------------------------------

https://www.bassetths.org.uk/prep-6-11-yrs/curriculum/
There is a phonics coordinator who oversees the teaching of phonics within the Preschool and Reception year groups. Mathematics A love for the English language is promoted in all classes. Pupils, regardless of their ability, feel that their imagination and use of vocabulary are two very powerful tools that enable them to communicate and inspire others. We encourage the children to understand each mathematical concept they encounter, so that skills and knowledge are embedded and consolidated in ability-boosting building blocks.

------------------------------------------------------------

https://www.bassetths.org.uk/prep-6-11-yrs/curriculum/
Maths mastery is achieved through the use of concrete resources and visual aids; using mathematical terminology consistently throughout the school; tackling the same concepts from different angles and adapted to different learning styles, and aiming for depth of understanding over breadth of coverage. Science We build on the children’s natural curiosity about the world around them to harness an enthusiastic approach to science.

------------------------------------------------------------

https://www.bassetths.org.uk/prep-6-11-yrs/curriculum/
We use ‘hands on’ and interactive learning to develop key scientific skills across a varied curriculum: dissecting a lamb’s heart, watching eggs hatch in a classroom incubator, hunting for invertebrates in the park, ‘exploding’ volcanoes by mixing vinegar with bicarbonate of soda and creating electrical circuits are all part of a Bassett House School scientist’s life. We ‘scaffold’ learning up through the school so that the children consolidate previous learning and add depth of understanding as they progress. We also emphasise the importance and relevance of science by exploring the discoveries, impacts and real-world applications of famous scientists and inventors.

------------------------------------------------------------

https://www.bassetths.org.uk/prep-6-11-yrs/curriculum/
Each week a child is awarded Scientist of the Week and annually we have a whole-school STEAM week, promoting Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Maths. We also take our science quest elsewhere: a much-anticipated Bassett House School thrill is our Form 5 trip to stay overnight in the Science Museum. Geography In geography, we encourage the children to gain knowledge and understanding through enquiry. We explore a range of case studies from the local area to the countries in the wider world, creating an understanding of human and physical geography.

------------------------------------------------------------

https://www.bassetths.org.uk/prep-6-11-yrs/curriculum/
Commencing from the start of our pupil’s educational journey, we might head out with iPads to photograph buildings in our neighbourhood to better understand our local environment, we use field work and outdoor learning to enhance the children’s understanding of different geographical processes. To further embed this, we might be looking at river courses in Suffolk, thinking about the topography of Salisbury Plain on a trip to Stonehenge, pondering urban planning in York or finding examples of coastal erosion in the Isle of Wight. History Bassett House School pupils are taught a wide range of historical topics, spanning different periods and places.

------------------------------------------------------------

https://www.bassetths.org.uk/prep-6-11-yrs/curriculum/
Our emphasis is on innovative teaching with cross-curricular links to ensure that the children not only learn content but also skills, including historical enquiry, developing a sense of chronology, and critically evaluating and debating historical accounts. The children are given a firm foundation in the chronology of a topic as well as exciting trips to provide context, drama to encourage empathy and research projects to promote independence of thought.

------------------------------------------------------------

https://www.bassetths.org.uk/prep-6-11-yrs/curriculum/
Activities that bring the past to life for our Bassett historians include dressing up as Victorian servants at Gunnersbury Park Museum, experiencing the sights and smells of the Vikings at York’s Jorvik Centre, creating their own Greek temples or Egyptian sarcophagi, exploring Stonehenge and Danebury Hill Fort, discovering the dynasty of Victoria and Albert at Osborne House on the Isle of Wight, and following in medieval footsteps by climbing York Minster tower. Religious Education In religious education, we explore a wide variety of topics including world religions, Judeo-Christian scriptures, values, beliefs, leadership, contemporary issues, significant people, saints, current affairs and moral dilemmas.

------------------------------------------------------------

https://www.bassetths.org.uk/prep-6-11-yrs/curriculum/
We enhance pupils’ awareness and understanding of the variety of religions and beliefs, teachings and practices, as well as of the influence of religion on individuals, families, communities and cultures. Lessons might include songs, stories, religious art and artefacts and, on special occasions, food and rituals. We visit centres of different worship in order to give the children some real-world insights into different faiths and we are fortunate to have parents willing to share their own religious practice by visiting us and telling us about it. Children from different religious backgrounds attend Bassett House and we celebrate our religious diversity by observing all the major festivals.

------------------------------------------------------------

https://www.bassetths.org.uk/prep-6-11-yrs/curriculum/
PSHE PSHE (sometimes known as PSHCEE or PSHCE) provides a timetabled opportunity for the children to explore themes of personal, social, health and economic education, with an emphasis on open discussion and debate. We take a consistent approach to teaching important moral values throughout the school and provide a safe and nurturing environment in which children are free to express their ideas and beliefs while learning to respect cultural, social and religious differences. We engage our pupils not only in our internal school community via our thriving house system, Citizenship Council and Eco Council, but also in the wider world by looking at current affairs, supporting local charities and inviting speakers such as police officers, doctors, nurses, firefighters and politicians.

------------------------------------------------------------

https://www.bassetths.org.uk/prep-6-11-yrs/curriculum/
Computing We cover all aspects of computing at Bassett House School: digital literacy, computer science and information technology. In timetabled computing lessons, from Reception onwards, children are encouraged to explore technology, solve problems and think logically. We aim to produce competent, confident and creative users of information and communication technology. Our children become digitally literate and learn how to use the internet safely, respectfully and responsibly. Most importantly, at Bassett House School, computer technology is one of the tools used to deliver the whole curriculum, whether creating a PowerPoint presentation on the life of a Roman slave, delivering a quiz on the human digestive system or racing one another at times tables.

------------------------------------------------------------

https://www.bassetths.org.uk/prep-6-11-yrs/curriculum/
All our classrooms are equipped with iMacs and interactive whiteboards (connected to teacher iPads) and we have banks of iPads, MacBook Air laptops and Google Chromebooks available for class use. French Bonjour! We teach French to help the children not only to start communicating in another language but also to assimilate different concepts of grammar and language structure. The emphasis is on understanding French through immersion, developing vocabulary through fun games and songs, using French language applications to support learning and gaining confidence in adopting the correct pronunciation. We participate in French competitions with other schools and take trips to see French films at the Ciné Lumière.

------------------------------------------------------------

https://www.bassetths.org.uk/prep-6-11-yrs/curriculum/
By Form 6, our children spend a week at a French château at which the staff speak nothing but French. We aim for Bassett House School pupils to progress to their senior schools with a can-do enthusiasm for learning foreign languages, as well as a grasp of basic French. Latin We teach Latin at Bassett House School because it enriches children’s English vocabulary, helps them to learn modern languages and draws upon other subjects such as History, Geography, Art, Drama, Literacy and Science. We focus on bringing Latin back to life using comic strips and songs, acting and storytelling (at times treating Latin as though it were a modern language). We look at classical history and civilisations and, during our Form 4 trip to York, explore a legionnaire’s life in the Roman army.

------------------------------------------------------------

https://www.bassetths.org.uk/prep-6-11-yrs/curriculum/
We also celebrate the Bassett House Latin motto, quisque pro sua parte, which we translate as ‘for each, the best!’: everyone should receive all that they need to excel. Prep Curriculum Overviews Our children benefit from being in a co-educational environment where girls and boys learn from each other, both academically and socially.

Head’s Welcome | Private School London | Basset House School Head’s Welcome Welcome to Bassett House School. There’s something quietly – yet confidently – wonderful about Bassett House. You sense it the moment you walk through our door: it is not in grand statements or a polished prospectus, but in the everyday, genuine warmth of our school family. We are a school with a big heart. You hear this in the laughter of children who feel at home, and you see this in the genuine relationships that underpin everything we do. And, thankfully, academic-excellence and kindness are not mutually exclusive in 2025. Founded in 1947 – and one of Notting Hill’s oldest preps – our school has successfully grown and evolved over the last eight decades.

------------------------------------------------------------

https://www.bassetths.org.uk/about/heads-welcome/
We have an excellent reputation locally, with many Bassett pupils being the second generation in their family to learn here. This is because we are a school for children beginning their learning 2025. I lead a school that is forward-thinking, unstuffy and totally child-focussed. Our teachers know their pupils well, and not just their strengths, but their quirks, dreams, and – crucially – their potential. All that said, I love the fact that one thing has remained from our founding motto and aim: children are reminded daily to ‘ Be the best you can be ’. We encourage the children to give their ‘Bassett Best’ in all that they do. Pastorally, this is a smaller school and there is much that comes with this that makes the children’s experiences so special.

------------------------------------------------------------

https://www.bassetths.org.uk/about/heads-welcome/
Academically, high quality, creative teaching is the norm. The teaching team here are all committed to providing a curriculum that is both challenging and ever-engaging. We are thrilled with our pupils’ outcomes in Year 6. Bassett pupils head happily off to some of London’s most academically-selective senior schools, and also to those schools that are perhaps less academically-selective, but where both parents and child are delighted with the outcome. Our greatest success will always be measured by the character of our pupils. There is much more I could say about Bassett. Our Mission Statement goes further in sharing what we stand for, but there is no better way to get a clear impression of Bassett House than by visiting us and speaking to the pupils, the staff, or to me.

------------------------------------------------------------

https://www.bassetths.org.uk/about/our-aims-mission-values/
Our Aims, Values & Mission Basset House School Our Aims, Mission & Values Discover how our aim, mission, and values create the uniquely special environment that is Bassett House School. Our aim: To enable and inspire children to be the best that they can be. …from our founding motto, “ Quisque pro sua parte ” – For each the best. Our mission: Bassett House is a coeducational non-selective school for children ages 3-11. Bassett pupils are reminded daily to be the best that they can be. When founded in 1947 the motto was much the same, albeit in Latin: ‘Quisque pro sua parte’ For each the best. We focus on what children can do because we know that achievement comes in all forms.

------------------------------------------------------------

https://www.bassetths.org.uk/about/our-aims-mission-values/
We proudly celebrate our most academically able pupils who go on to Year 7 at some of London’s most academically selective schools, and we also celebrate those for whom success is richly deserved in many and multiple other ways. We are an arts-rich school where we place huge importance on the learning of art, drama and music. We teach Bassett pupils to be rounded and grounded: our pupils are balanced. They are taught to show humility, be tolerant and always thankful for what they have. We are a smaller school and so Bassett pupils create a palpable feeling of a school that is welcoming with a big heart; it is caring and full of charm. We are also true to our founding vision in remaining a house school: our home-from-home atmosphere is a particularly special quality that we cherish.

------------------------------------------------------------

https://www.bassetths.org.uk/about/our-aims-mission-values/
And finally, our team of teachers are genuinely committed to working together to give the very best to Bassett pupils. For each the best. Our values: Commitment Courage Compassion Creativity Critical Thinking Communication What we do well: We focus on what children can do: achievement comes in all forms. All our pupils reach their individual potential (as was identified in our 2024 ISI Inspection Report). We send children to London’s most academically selective schools (St Paul’s Boys/City of London Girls/Latymer), and also less academically selective schools, but where children are happy and parents are delighted. We celebrate each child’s success but do not limit academic potential. We teach Bassett pupils to be rounded and grounded: our pupils are balanced.

------------------------------------------------------------

https://www.bassetths.org.uk/about/our-aims-mission-values/
We are not interested in the snobbery or elitism that can sometimes sit alongside the independent school sector. Instead, we focus on the very best of what an independent education offers: outstanding adult to pupil ratios; a creative curriculum, full of music, drama and art; and a breadth of cocurricular clubs and activities to maximise the value of the school day. We are an arts-rich school: we place huge importance on the learning of art, drama and music. As children’s lives become ever-more dominated by tech, we believe that the precious prep years are ones in which children should learn skills that they will love later in life. At Bassett House the teaching of these three subjects by specialist teachers engages children with the arts from the very beginning of their learning.

------------------------------------------------------------

https://www.bassetths.org.uk/about/our-aims-mission-values/
We are a smaller school and celebrate the fact that boys and girls are known by all our teachers. We are small enough to be bespoke and big enough to thrive. We celebrate our founding as a house school in 1947 with our first teacher and founder, Sylvia Rentoul, beginning a vision for a home-from-home atmosphere. We hold true to this today for our pupils in 2025. The feeling is palpable when you visit: it is welcoming with a big heart; it is caring and full of charm. We have a team of staff that work together with brilliant effect. As parents, you will know that working relationships with colleagues have a hugely positive impact on productivity, well-being and sense of purpose. We have an outstanding team of staff that are each united in giving the very best to Bassett pupils.

Dukes Festival of the Arts - Bassett House School Our Years 5 and 6 children recently had the incredible opportunity to take part in the Dukes Festival of the Arts, a truly spectacular event celebrating the highest standards of performance across all art forms. With over 900 children on stage, this was a once-in-a-lifetime experience, and we could not be prouder of Bassett’s performance and behaviour throughout. From the very first rehearsals to the final notes of the evening, our children showed outstanding commitment, progress, and enthusiasm in their singing. Their hard work truly paid off, and their performance was a testament to the dedication they have shown in preparing for this event. We hope the experience was even more special than expected—a real treat to witness.

------------------------------------------------------------

https://www.bassetths.org.uk/dukes-festival-of-the-arts/
While the fatigue may fade, what will remain is the joy of singing together, the sense of connection, and the pride of being part of something truly extraordinary. A special shoutout to Mr Moulton and Mrs Woodbridge for their unwavering support throughout and to Mr Woodward for being a judge! Where next?

Head’s Welcome | Private School London | Basset House School Head’s Welcome Welcome to Bassett House School. There’s something quietly – yet confidently – wonderful about Bassett House. You sense it the moment you walk through our door: it is not in grand statements or a polished prospectus, but in the everyday, genuine warmth of our school family. We are a school with a big heart. You hear this in the laughter of children who feel at home, and you see this in the genuine relationships that underpin everything we do. And, thankfully, academic-excellence and kindness are not mutually exclusive in 2025. Founded in 1947 – and one of Notting Hill’s oldest preps – our school has successfully grown and evolved over the last eight decades.

------------------------------------------------------------

https://www.bassetths.org.uk/about/
We have an excellent reputation locally, with many Bassett pupils being the second generation in their family to learn here. This is because we are a school for children beginning their learning 2025. I lead a school that is forward-thinking, unstuffy and totally child-focussed. Our teachers know their pupils well, and not just their strengths, but their quirks, dreams, and – crucially – their potential. All that said, I love the fact that one thing has remained from our founding motto and aim: children are reminded daily to ‘ Be the best you can be ’. We encourage the children to give their ‘Bassett Best’ in all that they do. Pastorally, this is a smaller school and there is much that comes with this that makes the children’s experiences so special.

------------------------------------------------------------

https://www.bassetths.org.uk/about/
Academically, high quality, creative teaching is the norm. The teaching team here are all committed to providing a curriculum that is both challenging and ever-engaging. We are thrilled with our pupils’ outcomes in Year 6. Bassett pupils head happily off to some of London’s most academically-selective senior schools, and also to those schools that are perhaps less academically-selective, but where both parents and child are delighted with the outcome. Our greatest success will always be measured by the character of our pupils. There is much more I could say about Bassett. Our Mission Statement goes further in sharing what we stand for, but there is no better way to get a clear impression of Bassett House than by visiting us and speaking to the pupils, the staff, or to me.

------------------------------------------------------------

Read article The pastoral care is excellent… the only complaint pupils have is that the school day ends too early. Read article Tatler “This non-selective favourite nestled in Ladbroke Grove has just unveiled a new 3,500 sq ft building and outdoor area without increasing pupil numbers – quite something for a central London school. The pastoral care is excellent too – there are off-timetable enrichment sessions, an in-house life coach and peace lilies (which, according to NASA, purify the air) placed in every classroom. Recent leavers have won scholarships to Latymer Upper and City of London School for Girls, and, reportedly, the only complaint pupils have is that the school day ends too early”.

Clubs | Prep School London | Basset House School Clubs Extra-curricular clubs offer a wealth of benefits for children. They provide opportunities to develop new skills and interests outside of the traditional classroom setting, fostering a sense of curiosity and enthusiasm. Participation in these activities can significantly boost confidence, as children discover hidden talents and excel in areas they may not have previously explored. A child who once struggled with maths may well excel once they discover they have a hidden talent for something else.

------------------------------------------------------------

https://www.bassetths.org.uk/enrichment/clubs/
Bassett House School offers a wide spectrum of activities that encourage self-expression and the development of talents outside the classroom, allowing children to explore new subjects, build friendships and connect with peers who share similar interests. Weekly clubs include art, animation, coding, cooking, chess, drama, fencing, horse riding, martial arts, netball, swimming and yoga. Visiting music teachers offer individual music tuition and pupils can join the school chamber choir, senior and junior choirs and instrumental ensembles including a rock band! If your child is a budding journalist, they have the chance to develop their reporting skills via our radio station club, ‘Bassett Radio’, and through our newspaper club ‘Bassett’s Big News’.

Trips | Prep School London | Basset House School Trips Fresh air and new experiences are vital for children to soar to greater heights. We encourage Bassett House children to gain independence, resilience, team skills, self-reliance, a willingness to take risks and an interest in the wider world by taking them on optional residential trips. These start at age 7 or 8 in Form 3. We recognise that for many children, a school residential trip will give them the first night they spend away from family, so, we focus on helping every child to feel secure and have fun in a new environment.

------------------------------------------------------------

https://www.bassetths.org.uk/enrichment/trips/
Our residential adventures include: a geography field trip to Suffolk, with after-dark nature trails and bug hunting backpacking by train to York for a week of cathedral city sights sleeping out in a homemade woodland shelter on a bushcraft activity expedition spending a week at an outward-bound château in France where only French is spoken a sleepover in the Science Museum, with scientific activities organised by museum staff.

How to Join | Private School London | Basset House School How to Join We want to make the admissions journey as smooth as possible! The following timeline breaks down each step, from your initial enquiry to your child’s first day at Bassett House. 1 - Attend an Open Event We believe that making the choice for your child’s education is one of the most important you will undertake. To make things easier for you, we host regular Open Events to allow us to provide you with a taste of our school and what we offer. Register for our next open event 2 - Register your Child We encourage all families interested in Bassett House School to register their child. For Nursery and Reception, registrations are accepted from birth, allowing us to note your early interest.

------------------------------------------------------------

https://www.bassetths.org.uk/admissions/how-to-join/
Please remember that registrations can only be accepted after your child is born. Register your child 3 - Visit us in person or virtually Once we have received your registration, we will be in touch to schedule either a personal tour of the school or if you are overseas a virtual meeting with our Head. This visit is a great opportunity to ask questions and for us to get to know your family. 4 - Formal Offers Offer of a place in Nursery (2+) or Reception (4+) Nursery and Reception offers are made based on availability, prioritising siblings of current pupils, children of alumni, and then the order of registration date, on a first-come, first-served basis.

------------------------------------------------------------

https://www.bassetths.org.uk/admissions/how-to-join/
When classes reach capacity, subsequent applicants are placed on a waiting list, from which further offers may be made if places become available, again adhering to the priority order. Early registration is strongly recommended to maximise your child’s chances of securing a place. Occasional places in Year 1 (5+) to Year 6 (10+) For occasional places, please contact the admissions team to determine if a place is available in your child’s year group. If so, your child will be invited for a taster day and assessment to evaluate their attainment and determine if they are a good fit for the class and curriculum. Additionally, we will request a reference from your child’s current school.

------------------------------------------------------------

https://www.bassetths.org.uk/admissions/how-to-join/
For younger children, the assessment focuses more on their ability to integrate with the existing class than on academic achievement alone. 5 - How to Accept an Offer of Place at Bassett House When you receive your offer, you will also be given instructions on how to accept the offer via our online form. Acceptance of a place must be accompanied by a deposit payment of £3,000. 6 - Before the first Day We want to make sure your child is comfortable with the move to their new school.

Sports Day 2025 - Bassett House School We held our annual Sports Day at Kensington Memorial Park on Tuesday 10 June, and it proved to be a very enjoyable afternoon! The children performed magnificently in a series of events including sprints, sack races, standing long jump, egg and spoon, relay, bean bag throw and foam javelin with each child scoring points for their respective House in each event. We also held sprint and 800 metre races, and a thrilling and hard-fought Inter-House Tug of War competition. Every child performed to the best of their ability in what proved to be a thoroughly enjoyable afternoon of sporting endeavour watched, as always, by a very supportive audience of parents and guests.

Year 6 Pupils Celebrate Outstanding Senior School Offers for 2024–25 - Bassett House School Bassett House School is proud to announce an exceptional set of results for its Year 6 pupils in this year’s senior school admissions process. The children received an impressive range of offers from many of London’s top independent schools and some of the UK’s leading Boarding Schools, showcasing the hard work, ambition, and talent nurtured at Basset House. This year, every Year 6 pupil received offers from at least one senior school, with a significant number achieving multiple offers and several being awarded sought-after scholarships. Belmont School was the most popular destination, with six offers secured by Bassett House pupils, including a prestigious scholarship.

------------------------------------------------------------

https://www.bassetths.org.uk/2025/04/14/year-6-pupils-celebrate-outstanding-senior-school-offers-for-2024-25/
Maida Vale School followed closely, with five offers awarded. Other schools extending multiple offers included Wetherby Pembridge, Queen’s College, Emanuel, and Harrodian. A total of four scholarships were awarded across a range of senior schools this year — a testament to the strength of academic, creative, and all-round talent within the cohort. Pupils also received offers from a number of highly selective and well-regarded schools, including Highgate, UCS, City of London School, Bradfield College, Epsom College, and St Benedict’s. We are incredibly proud of our Year 6 pupils for their resilience, dedication, and enthusiasm throughout the 11+ process.

In support of Comic Relief, pupils arrived at school sporting wild and wonderful hairstyles, paired with bright red noses to show their enthusiasm for this fantastic cause. The event was a great success, bringing smiles and laughter throughout the day, all while raising vital funds. A huge thank you goes out to everyone who generously donated—we are thrilled to share that we raised an impressive £465! Special recognition also goes to Summer, our Head of Student Council, who designed the vibrant and eye-catching poster that helped promote the event.

Years 3 and 4 Spring Production - Bassett House School During the final week of the Spring Term, Year 3 and 4 pupils put on an unforgettable performance of two classic fairy tales with a twist— Cinderella and Little Red Riding Hood —both from Roald Dahl’s Revolting Rhymes series. These lively musicals brought together the magic of storytelling, catchy tunes, and plenty of humour for an evening of entertainment that left the audience in awe. The pupils worked hard throughout the term, rehearsing songs, choreography, and acting skills. Cinderella , with its quirky characters and hilarious moments, had the audience in stitches, while Little Red Riding Hood was full of suspense and fun, with its unexpected endings and witty lyrics.

------------------------------------------------------------

https://www.bassetths.org.uk/2025/03/28/years-3-and-4-spring-production/
Both performances were adapted from Roald Dahl’s famous Revolting Rhymes , adding a modern and humorous spin to these well-known tales. The musical numbers were a highlight of the evening, with the Year 3 and 4 pupils showing off their vocal talents and energy. The costumes and set designs brought the whimsical worlds of Cinderella and Little Red Riding Hood to life, creating an immersive experience for all. Where next?

Dukes Festival of the Arts - Bassett House School Our Years 5 and 6 children recently had the incredible opportunity to take part in the Dukes Festival of the Arts, a truly spectacular event celebrating the highest standards of performance across all art forms. With over 900 children on stage, this was a once-in-a-lifetime experience, and we could not be prouder of Bassett’s performance and behaviour throughout. From the very first rehearsals to the final notes of the evening, our children showed outstanding commitment, progress, and enthusiasm in their singing. Their hard work truly paid off, and their performance was a testament to the dedication they have shown in preparing for this event. We hope the experience was even more special than expected—a real treat to witness.

Merry Christmas From Bassett House - Bassett House School What I hope you will see is the sheer amount of joy in the school over the last five days! There has been so much to celebrate with the children as we approach the end of term. Reception’s Production was charming, the Christmas lunch was delicious (it was really very good, and not even by school lunch standards!), and last night’s Festival of Carols was a powerful reminder of the importance of community and togetherness. I was touched by the number of comments from so many of you. Today we say farewell to William Terry and Ella Mcgrandle. Both Will and Ella leave us to travel before pursuing further study. Gap-students can be somewhat of a mixed bag as you might expect!

------------------------------------------------------------

https://www.bassetths.org.uk/2024/12/13/merry-christmas-from-bassett-house/
That said, both Will and Ella have been first-class members of our staff team. Their contribution has been exceptional. They are both so kind-hearted, committed to doing their best, and most importantly, brilliant at working with children. We said farewell to them in our final assembly today. And so finally, as we close the first term of the 2024/25 academic year, may I take this opportunity to thank you for your continued support. Bassett pupils are very special and they make for such a special atmosphere. I hope that last night was a little indication, perhaps, of my hopes for them throughout their time here: we – the staff – give them them the very best, and they in turn, rise to the occasion. Have a wonderful Christmas holiday.

The event holds particular significance, as it was inspired by a much-loved Bassett parent whom sadly passed from Motor Neurone Disease (MND) and it was his idea to bring music to this vibrant location. We are honoured to carry it forward in his memory. Proceeds from the event will go to the MND Association , supporting their vital research in the hope of one day finding a cure. Where next?
